One day, Mr. Poopybutthole and Mr. Pototo Head were walking in the park and they found a tiny little thing sticking out of the grass.
"What is this?" Mr. Poopybutthole asked.
"I have no idea at all. Wanna take a look?" questioned Mr. Pototo Head.
"Ok, Fiiiiine." Mr. Poopybutthole touched the little thing. He jumped back and looked at his hand as though he just touched something really hot.
"What is it?" asked Mr. Pototo Head.
"Why don't you see for yourself?" replied Mr. Poopybutthole.
Mr. Pototo Head stepped forward and groped for the small thing in the tall grass. He too jumped back and yelped. Just then, Mrs. Browncheeks was walking by with her dog and saw that Mr. Poopybutthole and Mr. Pototo Head were yelling about something.
"What's the matter?" asked Mrs. Browncheeks.
Both Mr. Poopybutthole and Mr. Pototo Head turned to her.
"Dog poop..." they groaned.
"Oh, cheer up. At least my dog made some nice doodies." she blabbered. And with that, she turned away, leaving Mr. Poopybutthole and Mr. Pototo Head stunned, clutching their stinky, brown hands, coated with smelly doodies.
